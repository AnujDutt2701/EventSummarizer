At a public meeting in Biharâs Hajipur district, both BJP and JDU workers present and the BJP supporters started shouting Ram Mandir, but the JDU leader Sanjay Verma cleared the air stating that Mandir should not be the core issue of campaign and strategy should be different when contesting for Lok Janshakti Partyâs Pashupati Kumar Paras, State Minister and younger brother of Ram Vilas Paswan.

3,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: With Lok Sabha polls just nine days away in Kerala, activists of an umbrella organisation of various Hindu outfits Saturday staged a dharna here to protest the alleged mass imposition of cases against them in connection with the Sabarimala agitation. 

 'Sabarimala Karma Samithi', which had spearheaded the agitation against the CPI(M)-led LDF government's decision to implement the Supreme Court September 28 verdict permitting women of all age groups into the shrine, alleged that their members had been implicated in various criminal cases ""unlawfully"". 

 Braving the scorching heat, a number of activists, including women, squatted on the road in front of the Secretariat here, and held 'namajapa' protest by chanting Lord Ayyappa hymns near the god's picture. 

 The outfit's protest, days before the April 23 Lok Sabha polls, rekindles the memories of the Sabarimala agitation, which had seen frenzied protests by devotees across the state and the alleged police action against them. 

 The parliamentary election in Kerala will be held in a single phase on April 23. 

 Addressing the gathering, Swami Chidanandapuri of the Kolathur Adavaitha Ashram here urged the Hindu community not to forget the ""barbaric acts"" of the police against the devotees during the Sabarimala protests. 

 ""The Karma Samithi will continue to raise the Sabarimala issue. It will not be a violation of the model code of conduct as the outfit is neither a political party nor a political movement,"" Chidanandapuri, who is also the chief patron of the Samithi, said. 

 The seer said the left government had no moral right to continue in the office in the wake of the action taken against the Ayyappa devotees. 

 Samithi leader K P Sasikala, who was arrested during the protests, said the outfit would extend support to those who had stood by them and the devotees during the stir. 

 Hitting at the state police for allegedly registering ""false cases"" against the Samithi activists and devotees, former DGP T P Senkumar said the police should act in accordance with the Indian Penal Code and CrPC (Code of Criminal Procedure). 

 ""They should implement the rule of law and not the law of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. Don't try to scare anyone by registering false cases,"" Senkumar, national vice-president of Sabarimala Action Council, said. 

 Sources in the ruling LDF said the party would petition the Election Commission against the dharna staged by the right-wing outfit. 

 Kerala last year had for days witnessed a series of violent protests by various groups of devotees and Hindu outfits demanding that the sanctity of the temple rituals be protected. 

 On September 28 last year, a five-judge Constitution bench had lifted the ban on the entry of women of menstrual age into the shrine.

4,"Farmers under the banner of the Kirti Kisan Union today visited the District Administrative Complex (DAC) and handed over a memorandum to Additional Deputy Commissioner (ADC) addressed to the Chief Minister mentioning that the date of sowing of the paddy crop must be fixed early i.e. June 1.

Notably, under the Punjab Preservation of Sub Soil Water Act, 2009, it has been made mandatory not to sow paddy before June 20. The main aim is to check the continuous depletion of underground water that is receding at 50 cm every year.
Agriculture officers continuously direct and appeal to farmers not to sow paddy before June 20. But the farmers said sowing the paddy this much late was only giving them trouble.

The president of the union, Santokh Singh Tagarh, said if paddy would be sown late, then it would also affect the sowing of the next crop, i.e. wheat, as it would get delayed further and various other problems arise with the late date of sowing.

 
The farmers said already there were numerous problems that were associated with the farmers such as in the absence of the pending amount for sugarcane, the farmers are left to take loans from arhtiyas and banks to make both ends meet. They have taken loans amounting to lakhs, and now, they were waiting for their payments by mills so that they could repay their loans.

They said the condition of potatoes was no less sorrowful. Almost three years have passed but the condition of potato growers was not improving. The farmers are continuously suffering and forced to bury their lush green crop, nourished by taking loans in the hope of earning some profit. In the absence of a remunerative price (as potato is being sold not more than Rs 250 per quintal as per them), the farmers say that they were left with no option but to destroy the crop.

Earlier, while protesting against the government, the farmers had said the government could not pay their dues and had failed to give dues for their sugarcane crops even after a lapse of over a year. It should not keep bragging about the crop diversification scheme in speeches and also it (government) must stop showing âfake sympathyâ towards them.

The farmers said the agrarian crisis was getting grimmer in the state. The issue was being deepened with every coming day.",Santokh Singh Tagarh,Punjab Preservation,-
